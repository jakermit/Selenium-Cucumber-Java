603 – Software Development Engineer in Test (Web/Mobile)
Imagine you are building news validation site to prevent fake news. You first story is to confirm that news from https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news is valid. The product owner wants to start with a simple confirmation by checking other sources to confirm a news article is valid. For the first news article on https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news your task is to search google/other resources for similar information to confirm that the article is valid. If two or more articles exist on Google or another resource then we consider the first Guardian news article to be valid.
Using Cucumber, Selenium or Appium, and Java, create a few scenarios to achieve this functionality.
